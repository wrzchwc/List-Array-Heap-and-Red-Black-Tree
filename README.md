# List, Array, Heap and Tree
## General characteristics
Project researches computational complexity of basic operations on data structures. It was written mainly in C++. 
Mersenne Twister Algorithm was used for random numbers generation. The data structures contain:
- binary heap
- red-black tree
- dynamic array
- doubly-linked list
## Binary Heap
Available operations include:
- insertion 
- root removal
- searching
## Red - Black Tree
Available operations include:
- insertion
- deletion 
- searching
## Dynamic Array
Available operations include:
- insertion at the beginning
- insertion at the end
- insertion in the middle
- deletion at the beginning
- deletion at the end
- deletion in the middle
- searching
## Doubly Linked List
Available operations include:
- insertion at the beginning
- insertion at the end
- insertion in the middle
- deletion at the beginning
- deletion at the end
- deletion in the middle
- searching
